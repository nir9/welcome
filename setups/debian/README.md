# Debian Setup

I currently don't use Debian anymore, but I am keeping the following information since this is linked from some of my videos.

#### Tools I like using on Debian
- QEMU (`apt install qemu-system-x86`)
- GCC (`apt install gcc`)
- strace (`apt install strace`)
- ltrace (`apt install ltrace`)
- xtrace (`apt install xtrace`)

#### Basic Debian Programming Setup

`apt install gcc manpages-dev vim git make`

#### Basic Linux Kernel Programming Setup

`apt install bzip2 libncurses-dev flex bison bc cpio libelf-dev libssl-dev syslinux dosfstools`

I also like using QEMU to try out the built kernel with the `-kernel` flag.
